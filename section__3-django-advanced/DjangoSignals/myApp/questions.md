Certainly! Below is a list of **interview questions** focused on **Django signals**. These questions are tailored for someone with **5 years of experience**, which means you will be expected to have both theoretical and practical knowledge of Django signals, including best practices and advanced concepts.

## **Basic Questions on Django Signals:**
1. **What are Django signals, and why are they used?**
2. **Explain the difference between pre_save and post_save signals.**
3. **What is the purpose of the `receiver` decorator in Django signals?**
4. **How do you connect a signal to a function? Provide an example.**
5. **How can you disconnect a signal in Django?**
6. **What are some built-in Django signals? Name a few and explain their use cases.**
7. **How do you trigger a custom signal in Django? Provide a sample implementation.**
8. **What is the difference between `dispatch_uid` and a regular signal connection?**
9. **Explain the concept of `sender` in Django signals. How is it useful?**
10. **How can you handle exceptions that occur in signal handlers?**

## **Intermediate-Level Questions:**
1. **When and why would you use `transaction.on_commit` with signals?**
2. **How do you prevent duplicate signal calls in Django?**
3. **What are the drawbacks of using Django signals excessively?**
4. **How do you test signals in Django using Django’s testing framework or pytest?**
5. **Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous signal execution in Django.**
6. **What happens if multiple handlers are connected to the same signal? How are they executed?**
7. **How would you connect a signal handler in a reusable Django app?**
8. **Can signals in Django affect performance? If yes, how can you mitigate these performance issues?**
9. **What are weak references in the context of Django signals? Why is `weak=False` sometimes used?**
10. **What’s the recommended way to organize and manage signals in a large Django project?**

---

## **Advanced-Level Questions:**
1. **How would you design a system that uses Django signals to audit changes across multiple models?**
2. **Describe a real-world use case where using a signal was preferable to overriding model `save()` methods.**
3. **How would you ensure that a particular signal only fires once for a certain operation?**
4. **What’s the impact of signals on database transactions? How would you make a signal run after the transaction is committed?**
5. **How can you pass additional arguments to a signal handler? Provide an example.**
6. **Explain the role of `apps.py` in connecting signals and why it’s necessary to connect signals in `ready()` method.**
7. **How do you ensure that signals from a third-party app don’t interfere with your Django project?**
8. **Can signals be used across different Django apps? If so, how would you implement cross-app signaling?**
9. **Explain how Django’s `pre_migrate` and `post_migrate` signals are used during database migrations.**
10. **What strategies can you use to debug issues with Django signals not being triggered?**

## **Scenario-Based Questions:**
1. **You have a model that needs to log every update operation. Would you use a signal or override the save method? Why?**
2. **You notice that a signal handler is being called multiple times for a single operation. How would you troubleshoot this issue?**
3. **Imagine you have two different models where saving one model should trigger changes in another model. How would you implement this using signals?**
4. **How would you use Django signals to implement a real-time notification system (e.g., notifying a user when a certain event occurs)?**
5. **What would you do if a signal handler takes a long time to execute, potentially blocking other processes?**

---

## **Practical Tasks or Coding Challenges:**
1. **Write a `post_save` signal that updates a user profile every time a user model is saved.**
2. **Implement a custom signal that triggers when a certain threshold is met (e.g., when an order exceeds a certain amount).**
3. **Write a Django signal that sends an email notification whenever a new blog post is published.**
4. **How would you implement a signal that updates the cache whenever a specific model instance is modified?**

---

## **Best Practices and Anti-Patterns:**
1. **What are some best practices for using Django signals in a large project?**
2. **What are some anti-patterns associated with Django signals? How can they be avoided?**
3. **When would you avoid using signals and opt for another approach?**
4. **How do you ensure that your signals don't introduce tight coupling between apps?**
5. **Explain the impact of signals on the overall maintainability of a Django project.**

### **Conclusion:**

These questions cover a wide range of topics, including basic theory, real-world scenarios, best practices, and potential pitfalls of using Django signals. For someone with **5 years of experience**, the expectation is not just to know the basics but to also have the ability to **design scalable, efficient solutions** using Django signals. Be prepared to answer these questions with both theoretical knowledge and practical examples from your experience working on Django projects.
